# Log Analyse

`log-analyse` allows scanning hundreds of log files for pre-determined pattern matches.
The aim of `log-analyse` is to allow teams to store an array of patterns that may be
of interest in an assortment of log files and be notified when various thresholds around
those patterns are met.
